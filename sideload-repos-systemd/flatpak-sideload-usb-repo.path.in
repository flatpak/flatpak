# This unit is intended to be installed in the systemd user instance, and
# depends on flatpak-sideload-repos-dir.service being in the system instance
# and running first. The idea here is that we add any USB drive mounts to the
# appropriate directory so Flatpak can find and pull from them in case they
# have flatpaks on them, both when a new drive is inserted and at the start of
# the user session.
