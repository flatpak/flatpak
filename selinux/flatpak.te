policy_module(flatpak, 0.0.1)

# The flatpak-system helper used to be a regular unconfined_service_t
# but this failed because it was not allowed to pass a unix socket fd
# over dbus-daemon. This module fixes that by creating an unconfined
# domain with some additional dbus permissions.

# I did try to make the domain confined, but it needs a lot of
# permissions and my selinux-foo just isn't good enough.
