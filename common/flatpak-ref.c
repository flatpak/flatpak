/**
 * SECTION:flatpak-ref
 * @Title: FlatpakRef
 * @Short_description: Application reference
 *
 * Currently Flatpak manages two types of binary artifacts: applications, and
 * runtimes. Applications contain a program that desktop users can run, while
 * runtimes contain only libraries and data. An FlatpakRef object (or short: ref)
 * can refer to either of these.
 *
 * Both applications and runtimes are identified by a 4-tuple of strings: kind,
 * name, arch and branch, e.g. app/org.gnome.evince/x86_64/master. The functions
 * flatpak_ref_parse() and flatpak_ref_format_ref() can be used to convert
 * FlatpakRef objects into this string representation and back.
 *
 * Note that the identifiers must be unique within a repo (e.g. Flathub) based
 * only on the name, arch, and branch 3-tuple, without regard to the kind. In
 * other words if app/org.gnome.evince/x86_64/master exists,
 * runtime/org.gnome.evince/x86_64/master must not exist. This requirement is
 * not enforced by libflatpak but is enforced by GNOME Software's use of
 * libappstream, since Appstream IDs are assumed to be unique.
 *
 * FlatpakRef objects are immutable and can be passed freely between threads.
 *
 * To uniquely identify a particular version of an application or runtime, you
 * need a commit.
 *
 * The subclasses #FlatpakInstalledRef and #FlatpakRemoteRef provide more information
 * for artifacts that are locally installed or available from a remote repository.
