      org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak:
      @short_description: Flatpak portal

      The flatpak portal exposes some interactions with flatpak on the
      host to the sandbox. For example, it allows you to restart the
      applications or start a more sandboxed instance.

      This portal is available on the D-Bus session bus under the
      bus name org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak and the object path
      /org/freedesktop/portal/Flatpak.

      This documentation describes version 5 of this interface.

        org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak.Spawn(), and it may still be zero if

        Emitted when a process started by org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak.Spawn()
        has fully started. In other words, org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak.Spawn() returns once the sandbox
        has been started, and this signal is emitted once the process inside
        itself is started.

        Only emitted by version 4 of this interface (available from flatpak
        1.8.0 and later) and if the notify start flag (64) was passed to
