Major changes in 0.9.98
=======================

 * libflatpak now correctly finds metadata for subset installations (like locale data)
 * flatpak build now supports --appdir which exposes the per-app directory in the
   user homedir. This is useful when testing builds.
 * The host fontconfig caches are exposed to the sandbox, next to the fonts in /run/host.
   This will (pending fontconfig work) allow sharing host fontconfig caches, allowing
   much faster initial startup for flatpak apps.
 * flatpak install now supports --no-pull
 * Added new extension property "locale-subset", which makes the extension point
   act like a locale extension (i.e. only install the subset configured by the
   locale).
 * flatpak remote-add --oci is disabled for now, as this is not up to date with
   the latest OCI work, and we don't want to break existing deployments if this
   has to change when this lands.
 * Parallel installation/updates are now safe because we take a filesystem lock
   whenever we prune the local ostree repo.
 * Flatpak run now works when important paths like $HOME, etc, are symlinks.
 * The ostree min-free-space property is is set to zero by default for the
   flatpak repos. This was causing a lot of problems for people, but the feature
   is still there if you manually enable it.

Major changes in 0.9.12
=======================

 * Fixed a regression in extra-data installation
 * Don't expose the a11y bus in flatpak build

Major changes in 0.9.11
=======================

 * You can now show all outstanding updates with: flatpak remote-ls --updates
 * The dbus filter "org.name.*" now means all subnames of org.name, not just
   the first level. This matches how dbus arg0namespace works, and how the
   comming dbus container support will work.
 * Fixed segfauld on update
 * Better commandline tab completion
 * Flatpak now exposes host icons readonly as /run/host/share/icons to the sandbox.

Major changes in 0.9.10
=======================

 Fix regression in dbus proxy that causes some apps to not
 work in 0.9.9.

Major changes in 0.9.9
======================

flatpak-builder was split out into its own module:
  https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder

 * When downloading to a temporary directory for later install to the
   system repo we now write to /var/tmp instead of $HOME. This is more
   likely to be the same filesystem as /var/lib/flatpak, and thus will
   not run into issues with e.g. filesystem full.
 * We now get the default language list from AccountService if possible.
 * A regression that made --devel crash was fixed.
 * New feature for flatpakrefs, SuggestRemoteName=remotename will cause
   flatpak to ask if you want to create a generic (not app specific)
   remote for the repo url.
 * flatpak build now does not die with the parent by default, you have
   to pass --die-with-parent. This was done because die-with-parent
   uses PR_SET_PDEATHSIG which does not work well if the parent is
   threaded, like e.g. gnome-software is.
 * We now always re-set the personality in the sandboxed process
   in order to avoid inheriting weird settings.
 * We now share a single dbus proxy instance for all proxies for a sandbox.
 * dbus-proxy now properly disallows old-style eavesdropping.
 * We now support accessibility by starting a customized dbus proxy for the
   a11y bus.

Major changes in 0.9.8
======================

Core:

 * Experimental support for peer2peer installation, enable with --enable-p2p
 * Add default language setting to flatpak config. Defaults to all locales for
   system installs and the users locale for per-user installs.
 * build-update-repo: Now always keeps the *two* latest deltas around to avoid
   race conditions with outstanding downloads at the time or running the update.
 * Support loading extra data from local lookaside cache.

Flatpak-builder:

 * Set terminal title to the currently building module
 * Added ability to specify http url for sources mirror with --extra-sources-url.
 * --install-deps-from=REMOTE installs the dependencies needed for the
   manifest.
 * New option --delete-build-dirs to always delete build directories,
   even on a failed build.
 * New property "add-extension" makes it nicer to create extension points.

Major changes in 0.9.7
======================

 * Don't re-download git repo when bundling sources
 * Build modules with no source if buildsystem is "simple"
 * Build cleanups

Major changes in 0.9.6
======================

This version requires the latest ostree version (2017.7) because it
uses a new feature that hardens the security of flatpak. Previously,
if you installed to a system-wide repository, the files created for an
application were as specified by the remote repo, but owned by root,
which could include problematic permissions like setuid or
world-writable. We now never create such problematic files or
directories on disk. Flatpak export was also changed to never
create problematic files in new apps.

Related to this, newly created flatpak installations also use the
new "bare-user-only" mode for the repositories, which means you
can now install applications even if your filesystem does not
support extended attributes.

Other changes:

 * flatpak info --show-metadata now only shows the metadata, in
   a machine parseable way.
 * build-export now records the flatpak version in the commit message
 * builder: The .pyc timestamp fixer now allows .pyc files with no
   corresponding .py file.
 * builder: New feature 'inherit-extensions' lets you copy extension
   info from the parent runtime.
 * builder: Set ExtensionOf in auto-created extensions (like Locale
   and Debug)
 * builder: Setting CPPFLAGS now works

Major changes in 0.9.5
======================

 Changes in flatpak:

 * Fix installation of installed tests
 * Don't show an error when updating if a remote is disabled
 * Store the app id in the X-Flatpak key when exporting a
   desktop file.
 * flatpak run: Handle paths when rewriting %u urls during
   file forwarding.
 * builder: Always assume separate builddir when using meson, as
   meson only works with this.
 * document-portal: The app-specific directory is always accessible
   to the app, take this into consideration for AddFull.
 * builder: Don't warn for unknown keys if they start with x-
 * Fix a race condition whe restarting the document portal
 * build-update-repo: Don't list removed deltas in the summary
 * list: Don't show .Locale/.Debug/.Sources by default. Show with -a.
 * remote-ls: Don't show .Locale/.Debug/.Sources, or non-primary
   arches (unless the primary does not exist) by default.
   Show with -a.
 * dbus-portal: Fix handling of NameHasOwner
 * builder: Add --export-only to export a previous build.
 * run: Allow regular files for --filesystem=xdg-config/path
 * run: Allow --filesystem=xdg-config/subdir:ro (previously
   it needed to be writable).
 * build-commit-from: Properly handle xa.ref when rewriting
   refnames.

Major changes in 0.9.4
======================

 Changes in flatpak:

 * Now requires ostree 2017.6 and bubblewrap 0.1.8
 * Better progress reporting in CLI and UI
 * Improved output from commands info, list, remotes,
   remote-ls: More detail, colors, nicer table formating.
 * New command flatpak repo that lets you show information
   about local repositories.
 * When launching exported desktop files, the paths
   passed to it are automatically created as documents
   to allow access to the arguments, if needed.
 * Flatpak install of an already installed application is
   now a warning, not an error.
 * flatpak build now kills all the processes in the
   sandbox when it exits.
 * flatpak update --subpath=... now updates the app event
   if there is no new upstream version, but the subpath is
   different from what is currently installed.
 * Exports are now whitelisted, and the only thing you can
   export are:
     desktop files, icons, dbus services, mime definitions, and
     gnome-shell search providers
 * Exported gnome-shell search providers are automatically
   disabled by default.
 * Exported mimetypes are rewritten to only allow globs, and to
   make the globs have a low priority vs system mime info.
 * A remote can now redirect to a new URL and/or a new GPG key, by
   using build-update-repo --redirect-url=URL --gpg-import=FILE.
   When clients see this they permanently change the local configuration.
   This is very useful when migrating official repositories.
 * flatpak caches in the homedir are now stored in ~/.cache
   (or $XDG_CACHE_HOME) instead of ~/.local/share/flatpak/system-cache.
 * Added version field to all exported dbus interfaces.
 * New AddFull method in the Document Portal, which allows
   exporting multiple files, as-needed by a particular target
   app. This is useful for implementations of dbus activation
   for desktop files.
 * New flag --no-static-deltas for install/update without
   using static deltas. Mostly useful for debugging.
 * TMPDIR is now unset in the sandbox, if set on the
   host. Each sandbox has a personal /tmp that is used.
 * Flatpak run now works if /tmp is a symlink on the
   host.
 * /etc/hosts and /etc/hosts.conf from the host are now exposed
   in the sandbox in addition to /etc/resolv.conf.
 * Titles and default branches are now automatically updated from
   the remote unless they are explicitly set. You no longer have
   to run flatpak remote-modify --update.
 * Some performance inprovements when installing apps.
 * When exporting a build, the commit objects now always include
   the branchname, the metadata and install/download size.
   The sizes are reused for faster summary building, and the
   others changes are for future use. The fields are verified
   against the deployed metadata during installation, so it
   is trusted.
 * Fixed minor race condition in portal application identification.
 * lib: New  flatpak_installation_update_appstream_full_sync method
   that allows progress reporting.
 * bash-completion: Fix out-of-bounds read that could produce
   weird completion at times.

 Changes in flatpak-builder:

 * Added support for appdata screenshot mirroring.
 * New property "install-rule" lets you change what Makefile rule to
   use in the install phase.
 * The git "commit" property can now specify both a tag object and the
   commit object it refers to.
 * New cppflags property, similar to e.g. cflags.
 * The "env" property now overrides the cflags/cxxflags/ldflags
   properties, to allow these to be reset.
 * Initial checkout of git/bzr to a temporary directory so that errors
   during checkout do not persist.
 * Properly take the "buildsystem" field into account when calculating
   cache freshness.
 * Don't crash if appstream-compose fails.
 * "ldflags" property now works  correctly.

Major changes in 0.9.3
======================
 Changes in flatpak-builder:

 * "rename-icon" renames in translated icons too
 * Moved manifest format docs to own manpage, "flatpak-manifest".
 * "bootstrap.sh" is now recognized as an autogen.sh alternative
 * Fall back to not using rofiles-fuse if it is not available.
 * Make sure flatpak-builder --run grants the app access to dbus.
 * Make paths paths for module includes and module dependencies
   relative to the included module rather than the "base" json file.
 * When cross-compiling 32bit apps on 64bit arches (like i386 on x86-64)
   then we automatically set a linux32 personallity.
 * Print warnings for unhandled json properties.
 * Make sure flatpak-builder --run works if --extra-data is in the
   finish args.
 * Take build-commands into consideration when considering if the
   build cache is stale.
 * Support for --extra-sources= to pre-seed downloaded sources.
 * Support for --bundle-sources which creates a runtime with the sources
   that were used to build the app.
 * Handle trailing whitespace in git submodule uris
 * Progress reporting while downloading files.

 Other changes:
 * build-export now always exports directories as readable and executable.
 * build-update-repo --generate-static-deltas now fork the work process
   rather than using threads, which avoids problems with this using
   a lot of memory in a single process in some cases.
 * Report flatpak version in HTTP request user agent.
 * New "flatpak repo" command added that has some options for maintaining
   a repository.
 * flatpak info can now report more information and handles multiple
   installed branches better.
 * Support non-default WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment var.
 * Handle application ids that end with .desktop when generating
   appstream data.
 * Documentation updates

Major changes in 0.9.2
======================

 * Fixed a use-after-free and some leaks in the dbus-proxy. This
   is not currently believed to be exploitable, but the proxy is a
   security boundary, so we still  recommend to update.
 * Regular updates now never allow updates to an older version
   than what is currently installed (unless you explicitly specify
   an old commit id). This closes a hole where a MITM attacker can
   force clients to downgrade to an earlier (gpg-signed) version of
   the application.
 * The automatic detection of --from in flatpak install now detects
   flatpakref extensions even in URIs that end in a query string such as
   https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-apps-nightly/plain/gedit.flatpakref?h=stable
 * OCI support now supports GPG signatures
 * OCI support now works with the system-helper for unprivileged systemwide
   installation.
 * Experimental support for the new ostree bare-user-only repo mode that
   allows flatpak to run on filesytems without xattrs. Set
   FLATPAK_OSTREE_REPO_MODE=user-only in the environment to use this.
 * builder: New property disable-fsckobjects for git sources
 * builder: New property commit for git sources. This lets you specify
   both a tag (for readability) and a commit id (to ensure the tag doesn't
   change).
 * builder: The manifest file format docs have been split out into its
   own manpage.
 * builder: App manifests now support specifying sdk-extensions that has
   to be installed for the app to build.
 * builder: When creating the platform, remove all sdk-specific extensions,
   allowing creation of sdk-specific extensions.
 * builder: Correctly handle absolute pathnames in the specified
   command.
 * builder: Support --default-branch which defined the branch to build in
   case the manifest doesn't specify one.
 * When exporting builds to ostree we now use the canonical permissions
   for bare-user files, which means the resulting builds can safely
   be used with the new ostree bare-user-only repository type.
 * The detection of "unmaintained" system extensions was broken, and
   in some cases these extensions were not found. This now always
   works.
 * Flatpak now builds with latest OSTree. This required some fixing for
   multiple definitions of the g_auto* macros as OSTree now exports
   those.
 * We no longer rely on ostree trivial-httpd for the tests, because
   this is optional in later versions of ostree. Instead we use
   they python SimpleHTTPServer.
 * The minimum glib version has been corrected to 2.44.
 * The minumum automake version has been increased to 1.13.4
   because some older version didn't work.

Major changes in 0.9.1
======================

This release mostly has changes to flatpak-builder and the build
machinery. All flatpaks built with this version can run
on flatpak 0.8.x, but there has been additions and minor
changes in flatpak-builder that may require minor changes
to existing builder manifests, see below.

The flatpak-builder build cache now uses an ostree feature called
rofiles-fuse. This allows the build to work directly against
hardlinked checkouts of the cache, because rofiles-fuse disallows
writes to the hardlinked files (but allows replacing them). This makes
cache commits and checkouts much faster. However, it also means that
installation cannot do in-place modification of files in the
installation directory. There is a new per-module property called
"ensure-writable" that takes a list of patterns and ensures all files
matching them are writable (by manually breaking the hardlinks). This
may need to be added to some manifests to keep them building in the new
version.

The cflags and cxxflags module properties now work by appending,
rather that replacing, when there are multiple values specified. For
instance, the per-arch or per-module cflags will be appended to the
base cflags. This may cause old json files do duplicate cflags in
some cases. Normally compiler flags are repeatable without problems
though, so it is unlikely to cause problems.

Here are a short summary of the rest of the flatpak-builder changes:

 * The build cache was changed so that it is not invalidated if
   the installed version of the SDK changed. This means that the app
   will not rebuilt if you updated the SDK. This is generally the right
   thing to do, as SDKs are meant to be compatible.  If you want
   to avoid this (for instance when building against an unstable sdk)
   you can use the --rebuild-on-sdk-change argument.
 * The build cache is now per-arch, so building on one arch doesn't
   invalidate the cache for another arch.
 * New buildsystem "cmake-ninja" which works like "cmake", but builds
   using ninja, rather than make.
 * New buildsystem "simple" which doesn't use configure or make, it
   just runs a set of shell commands specified in the "build-commands"
   property. Note: build-commands is also available to other buildsystems
   and are run between make and make install.
 * flatpak-builder now has build-runtime and build-extension properties that
   makes it easier to build runtimes and extensions.
 * FLATPAK_DEST is set in the build environment to the installation
   destination (i.e. typically /app). It is particularly useful when
   building an extension where the destination is more complex.
 * flatpak-builder now supports --from-git=URL which pulls the
   json manifest and related files directly from a git repo.
 * modules have a new no-make-install property which skips
   the make install step.
 * Modules and sources have only-arches and skip-arches properties,
   which lets you enable/disable them based on the build architecture.
 * build-options has a new property ldflags, which is similar
   to cflags and cxxflags.
 * flatpak build (and thus flatpak-builder --run) now supports
    dbus proxies when needed.
 * All git repos are cloned with fsckObjects=true, which means
   we verify that the repos are valid.
 * New flatpak-builder argument --build-shell=MODULE extracts and
   prepares the sources for a specified module and then starts
   a build sandbox inside it.

There are also some other changes:

 * build-export: Now supports --timestamp=ISO-8601-TIMESTAMP, which
   allows you to create reproducible commits.
 * The OCI support has been updated to the latest version of the
   OCI image specification format.
 * There is a new flatpak-bisect script that can be used to bisect
   flatpak applications, looking for regressions.
 * flatpak list got a revamp. It now shows more information, and
   shows both apps and runtimes by default.
 * flatpak remote-list was renamed flatpak remotes in order
   to minimize confusion with flatpak remote-ls. The old name
   is deprecated but still works.

Major changes in 0.8.4
======================

In addition to the regular list of bugfixes this stable release
include backports of one more feature required for making OpenGL work
well. Now extra-data using extensions (such as the nvidia driver) can
specify that it doesn't need a runtime to run its apply script. We use
this in the nvidia driver by making the script a static binary, which
lets us use the nvidia driver for multiple runtimes without requering
that a particular one is installed. We also support an extension point
supporting multiple versions, which will be use for sharing the
nvidia driver between different runtime versions.

Additional fixes:
 * Documentation fixes
 * Crash fixes
 * Fix xauth propagation in some cases
 * Don't remove origin remotes on uninstall if some other app
   is installed from it.
 * Don't reset what locales are installed when updating a locale
   extension
 * Disable splice for the documentation portal as it seems
   to be broken in fuse
 * Append, don't override XDG_DATA_DIRS in profile script
 * Fix progress reporting in libflatpak to go from 0 to
   100% once, merging the various phases.

Major changes in 0.8.3
======================

In addition to the regular list of bugfixes this stable release
include backports of a the updated OpenGL support from master.  This,
in combination with the work in the runtime allows flatpak to work out
of the box with out-of-tree OpenGL drivers, including the nvidia
driver.

Additionally, due to some complicated issues wrt ptrace and user
namespaces this version disables the use of user namespaces if
bubblewrap is setuid, as it cause problems for the way flatpak
portals identifies applications. (See issue #557 for details)

 * Better handling of errors for extra-data
 * Handle extra-data properly for runtimes (as well as apps)
 * Respect required version for runtimes (as well as apps)
 * flatpak list: Don't break if some local ref is not deployed
 * builder: Look for appstream data in /app/share/metadata also
 * builder: Fix buildsystem=cmake builds
 * Add progress reporting to extra-data download
 * Fix uid/gid for directories in document portal

Major changes in 0.8.2
======================

This is a bugfix and security update.

Some of the bind-mounts that flatpak sets up were not read-only as
they should have. This includes: extensions, system fonts,
resolv.conf, localtime and machine-id. Many of thse are typically only
writable by root, but some, like the user-specific fonts and
user-installed extensions could be modified from the sandbox.

Everyone using 0.8.x is recommended to update to this version.

Other fixes:

 * There are new configure options for where to install dbus configuration
 * Broken symlinks in the root directory no longer break flatpak run
 * flatpak run with HOME in /var now works
 * dri access now also handles mali devices
 * install handles --arch when installing flatpakrefs
 * system-helper activation fixed on systemd-less setups
 * dbus-proxy now works without /run
 * During installation, failing to update a dependency is now not
   fatal.
 * /etc is now fully writable when building runtimes
 * --filesystem=xdg-config/foo now sets up the bind-mount from the host dir
   even when not using :create.

Major changes in 0.8.1
======================

This is a bugfix and security update (CVE-2017-5226).

Flatpak now uses seccomp to disallow the TIOCSTI ioctl in the sandbox,
which works around the possibility to inject text on the controlling
tty (CVE-2017-5226).

This was previously fixed in bubblewrap in 0.1.6, but that change has
now been reverted as it introduced other problems for flatpak.

 * Update bundled bubblewrap to 0.1.7
 * Fix writing new file with O_EXCL in the document portal.
 * Allow appstream data that doesn't have .desktop in the component id,
   such as data for runtimes.
 * Drop json-glib dependency from 1.2 to 1.0
 * Builder: Fail if unable to read included file
 * OCI: Ensure exported layers are readable by everyone
 * Fix extra-data download in gnome-software
 * Fix update-mime-database trigger when installing via
   the system helper.
 * Updating an app by installing a newer bundle now works
   again.
 * Make /var/tmp not be on a tmpfs (it is now in
   ~/.var/app/$appid/cache/tmp).
 * Documentation / translation updates

Major changes in 0.8.0
======================

This is the first release in a new series of stable releases called
0.8.x. New features will be added to 0.9.x, and only bugfixes will be
backported to 0.8.x. The featureset of this release is a good base to
target if you're creating flatpaks that should be widely usable.

This release technically requires only OSTree 2016.14, and it build
fine with this, but we recommend using OSTree 2016.15, because of the
change in how it verifies the checksums of commits in delta files.

 * Flatpakrepo files now support a RuntimeRepo= key which points to
   a flatpakrepo file. This means the user don't have to manually
   configure a remote for the runtime, just reply to the prompt
   to automatically do this when installing the app.
 * We now support dependencies when installing bundles. This includes
   required runtimes, related refs, and the equivalent of RuntimeRepo.
 * The support for OCI in flatpak has been updated to the latest
   OCI spec version, and support has been added to directly install
   flatpak applications from an OCI image.
 * In flatpak install, the --from and --bundle options are now optional
   if the argument has the correct suffix (.flatpakref and .flatpak)
 * Flatpak install now supports -y to let you avoid interactive prompts.
 * build-finish: We now export mime type files with the right name.
 * build-finish: New --require-version option let you specify a particular
   version of flatpak, and older version of flatpak will not install
   or update to the new version.
 * build-sign: Allow signing all apps by omitting the id.
 * Fix regression in the document portal when adding named files.
 * build-import-bundle now signs the commit if you specify a gpg key.
 * Flatpak now reads configuration from /etc/flatpak/installations.d
   which lets you support multiple system-level installation paths.
   These can be accessed with new --installation=... arguments to
   most of the commands.
 * flatpak-builder: Support --jobs=N to limit parallel builds
 * flatpak-builder: Patch source got new options property that lets
   you pass arguments to patch.
 * flatpak-builder: New generic "buildsystem: type" option that
   replace the (now deprecated) "cmake: true" option. This
   supports "autotools", "cmake" and "meson".

Major changes in 0.6.14
=======================
 * Update bundled bubblewrap to 0.1.4 which has some nice bugfixes.
   If you are using an external bubblewrap it is recommended, but
   not required to update.
 * Requires OSTree 2016.14, which allows us to drop some old
   workarounds.
 * When installing an application system-wide, don't consider
   dependencies that are installed for the user only.
 * Flatpak install --from now tries to re-use existing remotes to
   avoid creating unnecessary origin remotes.
 * Using --filesystem=$dir when $dir is a symlink-to-directory now works.
 * Using --filesystem=$file to expose unix sockets to the app is now
   allowed.
 * By default all the directories in ~/.var/app (except the app), as
   well as ~/.local/share/flatpak are hidden in the sandbox.
 * New option --filesystem=$dir:create which will create the destination
   if it did not previously exist.
 * --filesystem= now supports for xdg-[config|cache|data]. This
   allows you access to the host versions of these xdg dirs. Additionally
   if you use these with a subdirectory, like:
     --filesystem=xdg-config/subdir
   then that subdirectory on the host will be shared with the per-app
   instance of the xdg-dir.
 * Builder now correctly handles app-ids that have dashes in them.
   Previously this generated invalid ids for the debuginfo and locale
   extensions.
 * The experimental OCI file format support was changed from creating an
   OCI container to creating an OCI image.
 * Fix regression where "flatpak update --appstream remotename" broke

Major changes in 0.6.13
=======================
 * The command line arguments for install/update/uninstall changed

   These used to take an application id and an optional branch name as
   two arguments. This meant you could not specify multiple apps
   to install in a single command. So, instead of having the branch
   as a separate argument we now support partial references.
   If you only specify an id we try to match the rest as best we
   can depending on what is installed/available, but if this
   matches multiple things you have to specify more details.

   For example you can use:
     * org.my.App//stable - Any compatible arch, stable branch
     * org.my.App/x86_64 - x86-64, look for available branch
     * org.my.App/x86_64/stable - exact reference

   This means install/update/uninstall can now install multiple apps
   in a single operation.

 * Application runtime depencenies are checked/downloaded

   Whenever you install or update an application we check that the
   required runtime is installed. If not, we check if it is available
   in any configured remote, and if found asks the user if/where to
   install it from. If it is not found, the install/update fails.

   You can mark remotes as --no-use-for-deps, which means flatpak will
   never search for runtime dependencies in such remotes. This makes
   the dependency search faster if you have app-only remotes.
   It is recommended that app-only .flatpakrepo file define this
   by specifying NoDeps=true.

 * remote-add and install --from now supports uris

   This means you can install flatpakrefs and flatpakrepos in a
   single command like so:

    * flatpak remote-add --from gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome.flatpakrepo
    * flatpak install --from https://sdk.gnome.org/gedit.flatpakref

 * flatpak run can now launch a runtime directly

   For example, "flatpak run org.gnome.Platform//3.22" will launch a shell
   inside a sandboxy with the gnome 3.22 runtime and an empty /app.
   This is useful for development and testing.

 * included bubblewrap was bumped to 0.1.3 which has a security fix
 * Support for defining the default branch per remote
 * remote-add/modify: --update-metadata pulls current title and default branch
   from remote summary file
 * Applications can now list a set of URIs that will be downloaded with the
   application. The app can then extract these and use as a part of the
   application data. This is useful for applications using freely downloadable
   parts that can't be redistributed elsewhere.
 * flatpak-builder: Support --finish-only and --allow-missing-runtimes
 * flatpak-builder: Support app layering

   An app can define a "base" application which is used for the initial
   content before the application is built. This way applications can
   be built in a layered fashion.

 * dbus proxy: The filtering has been tightened up
 * build-finish: Now exports icons for themes other than hicolor too
 * There is support in the app metadata for generic policies.

   These are read and propagated and supports overriding, but are
   not otherwise interpreted by flatpak. They can be used by other
   host services as static permissions for the application.

 * Support for extensions directories

   In addition to using flatpak maintained runtime as an extensions
   flatpak can now use raw directories in ~/.local/share/flatpak/extension
   and /var/lib/flatpak/extension. For example, if you create a
   directory called org.freedesktop.Platform.GStreamer.MyPlugins/x86_64/1.4
   there it will be used as a source for gstreamer plugins for all
   runtimes based on the freedesktop 1.4 runtime.

Major changes in 0.6.12
=======================
 * Partial revert in application id rules. Application ids
   can now only have dashes in the last element. This allows
   apps to export files such as org.my.App-extra.desktop which
   was used by the libreoffice builds.
 * By default the kernel keyring is not accessable, as it is
   not containable.
 * Some robustness fixes for build-commit-from
 * Better error messages
 * flatpak update --appstream now updates for all remotes
 * Made flatpak enter work, and you can now use any pid in the sandbox.
   However, it requires root permissions.
 * Support for --device=kvm for /dev/kvm access
 * Support for --allow=multiarch to support non-primary arch support.
   For example running i686 code in an x86_64 app.
 * Add new default-branch setting for the remote configuration

Major changes in 0.6.11
=======================

 * Dashes are now allowed in application ids. However, to still work  with
   symbolic icon names, they may not end with "-symbolic".
 * HostCommand now handles ptys correctly
 * Various documentation updates
 * New FLATPAK_CHECK_VERSION macro in libflatpak
 * HostCommand now returns the real PID rather than a fake one.
 * Fix regression in flatpak update --appstream
 * Fix regression installing bundles without origin urls
 * New flatpak-builder option --show-deps lists all the files
   the manifest depends on.

Major changes in 0.6.10
=======================

 * Dropped requirement for systemd --user.
   The way we detect if an process we're talking to is sandboxed, and
   what application id it has doesn't use cgroups anymore, which means
   that the dependency on systemd in the user session is now optional.
   This also means the --no-desktop argument is not needed any more.
   (It is still accepted but does nothing.)
 * Initial support has been added for .flatpakref files. These are simple key
   value files similar to .flatpakrepo files, however they specify an application
   to install in addition to the repo information. For example, gedit can be
   installed by downloading https://sdk.gnome.org/gedit.flatpakref and running:
     flatpak install --from gedit.flatpakref
   There is also library support for this so it can be added to graphical
   installers (such as gnome-software).
 * Requires OSTree 2016.10. The change in how OSTree handles mtimes in
   checkouts that was introduced in 2016.7 has been reverted, and
   the required changes in Flatpak has been made. This means that
   flatpak now depends on OSTree 2016.10.
 * Requires Bubblewrap 0.1.2 for builds using the system bubblewrap.
   Builds using the included copy need no changes.
 * The $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flatpak-info file has added information
   about the running application, and is now also securely available
   for a running application from the host as "/proc/$fd/root/.flatpak-info".
   This is what is used to identify remote apps instead of the cgroup
   info.
 * A new run permission --allow=devel has been added. An application with
   this permission is allowed to use ptrace and perf. This was previously
   only available during "flatpak build" and "flatpak run -d". This
   is useful if you're packaging e.g. an IDE.
 * When an application is updated or removed a /app/.updated or /app/.removed
   file is created for running instances. This can be used by applications to
   trigger e.g. a restart for the new version.
 * A new dbus request "HostCommand" has been added to org.freedesktop.Flatpak.
   This lets you run any command on the host, and is therefore clearly not
   sandboxed, so access to this should be limited. However, it is very useful
   if you're using flatpak mainly as a distribution mechanism, for a non-sandboxed
   application.
 * flatpak-builder now supports running from inside a flatpak, by auto-detecting
   this and using the HostCommand service to run recursive flatpaks.
 * Consecutive calls to flatpak build-update-repo has been speed up.
 * The document portal now allows sandboxed applications to create references
   to files in /app and /usr (in the app/runtime).
 * The update process noew doesn't stop at the first failure.

Major changes in 0.6.9
======================

 * Dropped dependency on libgsystem
 * Allow passing partial refs whenever a CLI command takes
   an app or runtime name.
 * New command build-commit-from creates a new commit based
   on the contents of another commit (optionally from another
   local repo).
 * The sandbox now contains $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/app/$APPID from the
   host (and the directory is created if needed).
 * update: Better output, and faster for the no updates case
 * build-export: Don't make most validation errors fail, instead
   just print a warning.
 * builder: Support local path references for git sources
 * builder: Better handling of recursive git submodules
 * builder: Fixed issues with the .pyc mtime rewriting
 * builder: Handle symbolic icons for rename-icon
 * builder: Add --stop-at=$module to do partial builds
 * builder: Add --sandbox flag to disable the build from escaping
   from the sandbox via build-args.

Major changes in 0.6.8
======================

 * Requires OSTree 2016.7, allowing us to enable use of static delta
   for system downloads again.
 * Support --no-desktop which allows you to run a flatpak app outside
   a desktop, with some loss of functionallity (for example, there
   will be no systemd --user scope created for the app)..
 * More documentation.
 * Memory leak fixes.
 * Initial support for rpms as flatpak-builder archive sources.
 * Start work on translating the CLI.
 * Install systemd config snippet to set the right XDG_DATA_DIRS path.
 * Support --arch in flatpak list.
 * Support access() in the document portal.
 * Validate exported desktop files.

Major changes in 0.6.7
======================

 * Automatically download and update related references such
   as locales when using the CLI.
 * lib: Support for getting related references
 * Document metadata format
 * Support build using system-installed bwrap
 * Allow access to the journal socket in the sandbox
 * builder: Support applying patches with git (useful for binary diffs)
 * Require ostree 2016.6

Major changes in 0.6.6
======================

 * Better support for multi-arch (for instance, will automatically install
   i386-only app on x86_64 without user having to specify --arch).
 * Support --device=all to access the full host /dev
 * More command line support for managing exported documents
 * Extended API for the document portal: Lookup, Info, List
 * flatpak-builder: Support initializing /var from a runtime
   extension.
 * Disable static deltas when updating via the system helper to
   work around bug in ostree.

Major changes in 0.6.5
======================

 * Documentation improvements
 * builder: Check that the specified command exists after build is done
 * builder: Fix up mtime in headers for python precompiled files
 * builder: Allow submodules and including modules from other json files
 * system-helper builds are optional (--disable-system-helper)
 * system-helper: Support installing from local remotes and bundles
 * Improved support for --subpath installs, including libflatpak support
 * Improved command line completion

Major changes in 0.6.4
======================

 * Fix an issue where flatpak sometimes created empty "repo"
   directories in the CWD

Major changes in 0.6.3
======================

 * Fix resolv.conf regression in `flatpak build`
 * Fix LD_LIBRARY_PATH override support in `flatpak build`

   unprivileged support for user namespaces (default for Debian).
 * Fix memory leak during install/update.
 * update: Fix support for --arch.
 * Set the right location for the system directory in the environment.
 * system-helper: Support updating without deploying (needed for
   gnome-software support).
 * lib: Fix support for updates

Major changes in 0.6.0
======================

Renamed from xdg-app to Flatpak.  Existing repositories should keep
working, and locally user installed apps/runtime will be migrated
automatically. However, there are some things that you have to be
aware of:
 * The command names are now flatpak/flatpak-builder
 * System-wide installed apps/runtimes need to be reinstalled
 * flatpak-builder uses a ".flatpak-builder" subdirectory instead
   of ".xdg-app-builder".
 * The bus name and interface name for the permission
   store is changed, it was in org.freedesktop.XdgApp, but is
   now in org.freedesktop.impl.portal.DesktopPortal.
 * The installation migration is a one-time operation so you can't
   go back to xdg-app after updating.
 * The library API (and name) changed due to the rename.

Other changes:
 * Flatpak now hard-requires ostree 2016.5
 * Switch from using xdg-app-helper to an included version of bubblewrap:
   https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap
 * Added a policykit-based system helper that allows you to authenticate
   via polkit to install into the system repository.
 * Added an experimental command to export/import applications and runtimes
   as an OCI tarball.
 * builder: Fix creation of locale extensions if there was no locale data in the
   build.
 * Its now possible to disable/enable configured remotes.
 * A lot of new tests where added, and we now support installed tests.
 * builder now has an optional --arch argument for multiarch building.
 * Builder modules can be disabled with "disabled": true.
 * Using --filesystem=/tmp now hides the system X11 sockets.


Major changes in 0.5.2
======================

* The way locale extensions work has changed. Now we build a single extension
  for all locales, but we allow you to specify a subset of it during installation
  and update time using the --subpath commandline flag.
  The main reason for this is that the many extensions didn't scale, both in
  technical terms (large ostree summary file size), but also in terms of the
  UI listing hundreds of uninteresting things.
* We no longer use sizes in the commit objects to get installed and download size,
  instead we store some extra metadata in the summary file. This allows us
  to get much faster access to these, as with recent ostree versions we can
  cache the summary file.
* New command xdg-app build-sign that lets you sign a commit at any time.
* New argument xdg-app build --force-clean that removes pre-existing build dirs.
* xdg-app run now uses the "current" version as the default if you specify no
  branch or arch. It used to default to the "master" branch. This will default
  to the last installed version, but can be changed with xdg-app make-current.
* Added config-opts to the build-options in xdg-app-builder. This allows you
  to extend the configure flags in an arch dependent way.
* Documentation updates

Major changes in 0.5.1
=======================
* Make xdg-app-builder --build-only not export the results
* Create all-in-one Locale extension that combines all the locale extensions

  It is now cleaner and works on 32bit.
* Honor the noenumerate flag on remotes in CLI and libxdg-app.
* Add change notification for permissions store
* Require signed summaries for gpg-signed remotes
* Fix summary signatures of deltas in xdg-app build-update.

Major changes in 0.4.13
=======================
* Fix misgeneration of appdata xml in some cases
* Various improvements to bundles, and support in libxdgapp
* Add sources to Debug extensions created by xdg-app-builder
* Allow specifying subdirs of xdg-* dirs, for instance:
   --filesystem=xdg-download/some-dir
* Add support for --filesystem=xdg-run/subdir which means
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR dir, rather than xdg-user-dirs.
* Add --generate-static-deltas option to build-update-repo.

Major changes in 0.4.12
=======================
* Fix crashes.
* Update exports when removing apps.
* Remove appstream and repo refs when removing a remote.
* Add some build options to make libxdg-app usable inside a sandbox.
* xdg-app-builder builds are now in the .xdg-app-builder/build subdir.
* Make system repo bare-user to avoid creating any setuid binaries.
* Add xdg-app-builder --run operation that runs a command with the
  build environment set up.
* Support creating locale extensions with xdg-app-builder.
* Add support for tags to metadata.
* Put runtime info and tags in the appstream data

Major changes in 0.4.11
=======================
* Fix assertion when installing runtime

Major changes in 0.4.10
=======================
* App desktop files and icons were not being exported to the desktop

Major changes in 0.4.9
======================
* Fix crash at end of runtime install.
* xdg-app-builder has a new source type "shell" which lets you run arbitrary
  shell commands.
* Allow apps with writable homedir access to modify the xdg-app repos.
* New xdg-app info command gives you status of an installed app or runtime.
* The xdg-app-builder cache now contains the sdk commit id, so that a new
  version of the sdk invalidates the cache.
* Fixed a regression in the xdg-app install-app backwards compatibility
  handling.
* xdg-app now gives the application access to the deployment path, which can
  be used to give host-side services access to app files (such as help
  documents).
* build-export no longer exports appstream files, and when generating appstream
  files we don't need them to be.
* The default architecture tag used by xdg-app is now made canonical when needed
  (i.e. on arm/x86/mips).

Major changes in 0.4.8
======================
* Changed global installation directory to /var/lib/xdg-app (not /var/xdg-app).
* Add support for a dbus filtering on the system bus.
* Choosing user namespaces or setuid is now a runtime option, not build time.
* Fix xml-escaping in the appstream generation.

Major changes in 0.4.7
======================
* Enabled build of libxdg-app by default, now the API is stable
  enough for e.g. gnome-software to use it.
* Restructured the command line interface to xdg-app, it is now
  more streamlined and easy to use. For instance, to install
  both apps or runtimes, now use "xdg-app install $name".
  The old commands still work, but are deprecated and not
  in the docs.
* xdg-app-builder has gotten a bunch of new features that
  makes it easier to build apps, and some initial work to
  make it possible to create runtimes using it
* build-export now finds and export any app-info installed by
  the app, and build-update-repo collects all such exports
  into a per-repo branch for appstream and icons.
* The client (and libs) support for locally mirroring the appstream
  branch for each remote. This allows use to create graphical appstores
  with user-readable information and icons.
* On the client side one can now specify priorities for each
  remote.

Major changes in 0.4.6
======================
* Added an initial version of libxdg-app, a highlevel library
  intended to be used by user interface frontends to xdg-app.
  It is not yet API stable, so it is disabled by default.
  Enable with --enable-libxdgapp
* Added xdg-app-builder, a separate tool that makes it easier to build
  applications with external dependencies.
* Add support for single-file bundles, which can be a useful way
  to distribute apps on e.g. a usb stick. Only works with the
  latest version of ostree.
* Always allow apps to talk to the built-in portals
* Support granting read-only access to the filesystem with e.g. --filesystem=host:ro

* Don't block ptrace and perf in debug and build runs
* Put nvidia drivers in sandbox if DRI allowed
* Support specifying a version for runtime extensions

Major changes in 0.4.0
======================
* A new permissions store was added to the dbus api.
  This can be used by portal implementations that want to store
  per-app permissions for objects.
* The document portal was added. This is a dbus api
  which you can use to create document ids and assign
  apps permissions to see these documents. The documents
  themselves are accessed via a custom fuse filesystem.
* perf and strace are now blocked via the seccomp filters
* You can now override application metadata on a system
  and per-user level, giving apps more or less access
  than what they request.
* New command modify-remote added which lets you change
  configuration of a remote after it has been added with
  add-remote.
* Support for adding trusted gpg keys on a per-remote basis
  has been added to add-remote and modify-remote.
* The repo-contents command has been renamed to ls-remote
  to better match the other commands.
* The list-remotes command can now show more information
  about the remotes.
* The bash completion implementation has been improved.
