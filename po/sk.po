#. - Authorisation to actually install software is controlled by
#. org.freedesktop.Flatpak.app-install.
#. - This action is checked after app-install, as it can only be done
#. once the app’s data (including its content rating) has been
#. downloaded.
#. - This action is checked to see if the installation should be allowed
#. based on whether the app being installed has content which doesn’t
#. comply with the user’s parental controls policy (the content is
#. ‘too extreme’).
#. - It is checked only if an app has too extreme content for the user
#. who is trying to install it (in which case, the app is ‘unsafe’).
#. - Typically, normal users will need admin permission to install apps
#. with extreme content; admins will be able to install it without
#. additional checks.
#. - In order to configure the policy so that admins can install safe and
#. unsafe software anywhere without authorisation, and non-admins can
#. install safe software in their user or system dirs without
#. authorisation, but need authorisation to install unsafe software
#. anywhere:
#. * Unconditionally return `yes` from `app-install`.
#. * Return `auth_admin` from `override-parental-controls` for users
#. not in `@privileged_group@`, and `yes` for users in it.
#. * Set the malcontent `is-{user,system}-installation-allowed`
#. properties of all non-admins’ parental controls policies to true.
#. - In order to configure the policy so that admins can install safe and
#. unsafe software anywhere without authorisation, and non-admins can
#. install safe software in their user dir without authorisation, but
#. need authorisation to install safe software in the system dir or to
#. install unsafe software anywhere:
#. * Unconditionally return `yes` from `app-install`.
#. * Return `auth_admin` from `override-parental-controls` for users
#. not in `@privileged_group@`, and `yes` for users in it.
