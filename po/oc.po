#. - Authorisation to actually install software is controlled by

#. - This action is checked after app-install, as it can only be done
#. once the app’s data (including its content rating) has been
#. downloaded.
#. - This action is checked to see if the installation should be allowed
#. based on whether the app being installed has content which doesn’t
#. comply with the user’s parental controls policy (the content is
#. ‘too extreme’).
#. - It is checked only if an app has too extreme content for the user
#. who is trying to install it (in which case, the app is ‘unsafe’).
#. - Typically, normal users will need admin permission to install apps
#. with extreme content; admins will be able to install it without
#. additional checks.

#. unsafe software anywhere without authorisation, and non-admins can
